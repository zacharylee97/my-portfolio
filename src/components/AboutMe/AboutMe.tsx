    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am a full-stack web developer with a background in life sciences. Having
      worked in multiple research labs, I have experience collaborating on a
      project and I have enjoyed working in a group setting. I decided to become
      a web developer because I became interested in computer science after I
      took a basic Java course in university. I am an artistic and creative
      person, which lends itself to front-end development and user interface
      design. I also like the challenge of thinking logically when working on
      back-end development. Through my work experience, Iâ€™ve found that I enjoy
      working on the database side of things as well, designing the structure
      and writing queries.
